# animation-exploration

## About

Simple project created to test the integration of the reanimated library and styled-components. The application is composed of two screens
the first one just renders three simple chained animations and has a button that navigates to the second screen. The second screen renders 
a more complex animation of a circle view that is filled after a timeout delay, the percentage of that circle view that is filled as well as 
the filling color and other parameters are customizable.
